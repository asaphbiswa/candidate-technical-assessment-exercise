This program allows the users to search the members using their id and names in the database from client side which is your local machine. 

To execute this program, you have to use Spring Tool Suite 4 IDE: to run the code, MySQL database: to get the members records. 

Direction* import the folders (files) in the IDE and run as Spring Boot App. Make sure you have table created in the database (MySQL Workbench) with records that have the id and name.


To Test the program, I have written JNIT unit tests under the src/test/java folder in the project. 
To run the tests, just right click on the test method name inside the Test class and run it as jnit test.


I used POSTMAN to send the requests.
